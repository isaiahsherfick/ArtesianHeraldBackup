# ArtesianHeraldBackup
An application I'm toying with focused around practicing SQL to develop a really robust digital backup of 
all the existing artesian herald issues. Will include an executable file that allows for searches by year, author, title, adviser at the time, 
editors, photographers, etc. Hopefully will eventually contain pdf versions of all issues in existence.
